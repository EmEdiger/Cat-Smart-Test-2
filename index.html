        A scheme launched last year with the aim of reducing the number of stray cats in Sheffield has been hailed as a success – the free <a href="https://www.rspca.org.uk/getinvolved/donate/gift?formId=335&source=18ACS10022&utm_source=PR&utm_medium=Friendly&utm_content=CatSmart&utm_campaign=DonationProducts ">Cat Smart</a> scheme has prevented 1120 cat litters since August 2017.

        The year-long scheme was implemented to advocate and aid the neutering of home and stray cats in the face of the city’s stray cat crisis; with World Spay Day just around the corner, new slots have become available for more cats to be neutered.
        </p>
        <p>
        Carrie Stones, a cat population control manager for the RSPCA, said the project was spear-headed and funded by the national charity in collaboration with various local cat charities, such as Rain Rescue and The Sheffield Cats Shelter, and other veterinary clinics in the city.
        </p>
        <p>
        Cat owners are given vouchers to redeem free neutering services for their cats at participating clinics and “pop up clinics” have also been set-up around well-populated areas like libraries.

    Ms Stones said the extent at which the vouchers are being redeemed is being monitored by the RSPCA in an effort to understand exactly how cat owners are taking advantage of the scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
    The scheme is targeted at the S1, S2, S4, S5 and S9 areas of Sheffield, but it will also be expanded to other cities in the future.

    Ms Stones said: “The work that’s been done here will seed into a control strategy for the north, and then we would like to expand it.”
    </p>
    <p>
She said the S5 postcode was one of the most affected areas, but added that cat shelters in the city-centre and in Rotherham were also at full capacity at all times, with a long waiting list of cats to be homed.
</p>
        <p>
        “People want to rehome cats because they’re moving house but they can’t take them to a rehoming centre because they’re full. Time is not on their side, so sometimes the cats are left on that property.
        </p>
        <p>
        “There are simply not enough people wanting cats to be able to look after them – the population is currently unsustainable.”
        </p>
        <p>
        Neutering also benefits a cats’ health – it prevents cancer and other health problems, and reduces the chances of male cats running away or fighting with other cats over territory.

        Miss Stones added that house cats need microchipping just as much as stray cats, because “cats are naturally curious – if they can find a way out they often do.
        </p>

        <p>
        “Unfortunately it’s the male cats that are involved in road traffic accidents the most, and that’s because it doesn’t matter if there’s a juggernaut there- if their lady love’s on the other side of the road, that’s the only thing the cat’s focused on.”

        Maggie Skinner, founder of Friends of Ferals, a Sheffield-based cat charity, said: “It’s really good that people can pick up the phone or they can email and the voucher will be theirs. It includes chipping, so what can be better than that?”

        Local cat owners in Sheffield are also keen on the scheme. Susie Bennett, who lives in Endcliffe, said: “I definitely support it, it sounds like a good initiative. Seems like they are not doing enough to make people aware of the scheme though if I, as a cat owner, have never heard of it.
        </p>
        <p>
        “Stray cats were a problem where I used to live in Stannington.”
        </p>
        <p>
        The scheme will run through the rest of the year, with hopes of preventing thousands of cats and kittens from ending up in shelters unnecessarily.
